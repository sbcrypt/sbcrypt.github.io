## Lesson 1.2: Symmetric Cryptography & The Substitution Cipher

Picture this:

-   Alice wants to send a message to Bob.
-   Oscar is lurking, ready to snoop.

**Solution:** Use a symmetric cipherâ€”both Alice and Bob share a secret key ðŸ”‘.

This is like whispering in a made-up language only you and your bestie understand.

### ðŸ§  Key Concepts:

-   **Plaintext (x):** The original message.
-   **Ciphertext (y):** The scrambled version.
-   **Key (k):** The secret rule both sides use to encrypt/decrypt.

### ðŸ§© Example: The Substitution Cipher

This cipher is old school cool. You replace each letter in the alphabet with a different one.

**Example Key:**
```
A â†’ M
B â†’ Q
C â†’ D
... and so on
```

So the word `ABBA` becomes `MQQM`

This is a 1-to-1 mapping, making it easy to understand but not super secure.

### ðŸ§¨ Ways to Break It:

1.  **Brute Force Attack**
    -   Try every possible substitution (that's 26! = 403,291,461,126,605,635,584,000,000 combos ðŸ˜±)
    -   Oscar doesn't love thisâ€”it's slow.

2.  **Frequency Analysis**
    -   Oscar is smart. He counts how often letters appear.
    -   In English, `E` is the most common letter.
    -   So if a mystery letter shows up a lot, chances are it's `E`.

ðŸ“Š Cryptanalysis meets statistics!

### ðŸ”’ The Real Lesson Here:

Good cryptography:

-   Shouldn't rely on "keeping the method secret"
-   Should only rely on keeping the **key** secret
-   Must make ciphertext look like random gibberish

This is called **Kerckhoffs' Principle:**

> A cryptosystem should be secure even if everything about it is publicâ€”except the key.

Alrightâ€”Lesson 1.2 is now complete!
We're all warmed up to hit modular arithmetic and historical ciphers (which we just covered in Lesson 1.4).
