## Lessons Learned (Chapter 4)

1. **AES replaced DES** with larger keys/blocks and better security:
   - Selected in 2001 after a public competition
   - Offers 128, 192, or 256-bit keys
   - Uses a 128-bit block size
   - Designed by Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen (Rijndael)

2. **Galois Fields (GF(2‚Å∏))** enable non-linear byte transformations:
   - Bytes are treated as polynomials
   - Addition is performed with XOR
   - Multiplication uses polynomial arithmetic modulo an irreducible polynomial

3. **AES uses a Substitution-Permutation Network (SPN)** with multiple rounds:
   - 10 rounds for 128-bit keys
   - 12 rounds for 192-bit keys
   - 14 rounds for 256-bit keys

4. **Each AES round has 4 transformations:**
   - SubBytes (byte substitution using S-box) - provides confusion
   - ShiftRows (row-wise permutation) - provides diffusion
   - MixColumns (column-wise mixing) - provides further diffusion
   - AddRoundKey (XOR with round key) - adds key material
   - The final round skips MixColumns

5. **Key Expansion** turns the original key into many round keys:
   - Uses rotations, S-box substitutions, and XOR operations
   - Round constants ensure uniqueness
   - Creates 1 more round key than the number of rounds

6. **AES is remarkably secure:**
   - No practical attacks exist against the full cipher
   - Brute forcing is computationally infeasible
   - Side-channel attacks target implementations, not the algorithm

7. **AES is everywhere in modern systems:**
   - Network security (Wi-Fi, TLS, VPNs)
   - Storage encryption (BitLocker, FileVault)
   - Hardware acceleration in CPUs and devices
   - Used with various modes of operation (CBC, CTR, GCM)

8. **AES decryption is not identical to encryption:**
   - Uses inverse operations (InvSubBytes, InvShiftRows, InvMixColumns)
   - Round keys are applied in reverse order
   - Can be optimized with equivalent inverse cipher transformations

AES has proven to be a resilient and versatile standard that continues to secure our digital world. Its mathematical foundations, careful design, and resistance to attacks have kept it as the gold standard for symmetric encryption.
