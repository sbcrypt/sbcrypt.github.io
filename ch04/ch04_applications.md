## Lesson 4.7: AES in Real Life - Practical Applications

AES has become the de facto standard for symmetric encryption worldwide, powering security in countless applications and systems.

### AES in Network Security

- **Wi-Fi:** WPA2 and WPA3 protocols use AES-CCMP for securing wireless networks
- **SSL/TLS:** Secures your HTTPS connections for safe browsing and online transactions
- **VPNs:** Many Virtual Private Networks use AES to encrypt traffic
- **SSH:** Secure Shell typically uses AES for the encryption component

### AES in Storage Security

- **Disk Encryption:** 
  - **BitLocker** (Windows)
  - **FileVault** (macOS)
  - **LUKS** (Linux)
  - **VeraCrypt** and other cross-platform tools

- **File/Folder Encryption:** Numerous applications use AES for encrypting individual files and folders

### AES in Hardware

- **AES-NI:** Intel's AES-New Instructions - CPU extensions that accelerate AES operations
- **Dedicated Hardware:** Specialized chips for high-speed AES encryption in networking equipment
- **Smart Cards & Security Tokens:** Use AES for secure authentication and data storage
- **Mobile Devices:** Hardware-accelerated AES for phone storage encryption

### AES Modes of Operation

AES is a block cipher, but is often used with various modes of operation to handle data streams:

- **ECB (Electronic Codebook):** The simplest mode, but generally not recommended for most applications
- **CBC (Cipher Block Chaining):** Each block's encryption depends on the previous block
- **CTR (Counter):** Turns AES into a stream cipher using a counter value
- **GCM (Galois/Counter Mode):** Provides both encryption and authentication
- **XTS:** Specialized mode for disk encryption

### AES in Standards and Compliance

- **FIPS 197:** The official AES standard
- **NIST Recommendations:** Various NIST publications specify best practices for AES use
- **PCI-DSS:** Payment Card Industry requirements mandate AES for protecting cardholder data
- **HIPAA:** Healthcare regulations often require AES-level encryption
