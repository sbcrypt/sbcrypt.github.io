# Cryptography: Your Secret Superpower

We're about to turn cryptography into your secret superpower—fun, clear, and one lesson at a time. Think of this as your personal spy-school where you'll learn how messages stay safe from prying eyes (and how they can be cracked too 👀).

## 🧠 Mission #1: The Basics of Cryptography (Chapter 1)

Welcome to Crypto 101! Let's set the stage with a few cool characters:

-   **Alice and Bob:** Our go-to good guys who want to send secret messages.
-   **Oscar:** The pesky eavesdropper trying to intercept their messages.
-   **You:** The rising cryptographer ready to stop Oscar in his tracks.

## 🔐 What is Cryptography?

Cryptography is like giving your message a Harry Potter invisibility cloak. It makes information unreadable to everyone except the intended person.

But wait—**cryptology** is the bigger umbrella. It includes:

-   **Cryptography:** How to hide stuff.
-   **Cryptanalysis:** How to break stuff 😈.

## 🎩 Types of Cryptography Magic

### Symmetric Cryptography 🪄

-   One shared key to lock and unlock.
-   Like giving your friend a diary key—only you two can read it.

### Asymmetric Cryptography 🧙‍♂️

-   Two keys: public to lock, private to unlock.
-   Kind of like a locked mailbox—anyone can drop letters in, but only you can open it.

### Protocols 🧾

-   These are the rulebooks—how Alice and Bob use the keys safely. Think of it like a secret handshake with extra steps.

## ✉️ Lesson 1.1: Alice and Bob Want to Chat

They want to talk, but Oscar is listening. So:

1.  Alice encrypts message: "The cake is a lie." ➡️ turns into: `Yxg frzv ku h owp`.
2.  Bob decrypts it using the shared key.

This is symmetric cryptography in action.

But wait—what's the danger? If Oscar gets the key… game over. That's why the key must be secretly shared.

## 🎮 Bonus Mini-Game: Substitution Cipher!

This is the OG cipher from ancient times:

-   Replace every letter with another letter.
-   `HELLO` might become `KHOOR`.

Oscar might struggle… unless he knows letter frequencies! In English:

-   `E` is most common
-   `T`, `A`, `O` follow closely

This is how frequency analysis breaks simple ciphers. 🔓

## 🧪 Crypto Rule #1:

> Even if your cipher has a billion combinations, if it doesn't hide letter patterns, it's toast.
